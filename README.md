## Overview
"GuessTheNumber" is a website containing a simple guessing game.
For this page my focus was on the Interface Design. 
I wanted to create it with a minimal/retr√≤ style combining colors, typography and illustrations.


## Accessibility
Using semantic HTML tag and ARIA 
`aria-live`
I also made it accessible for people who use keyboard-only and screenreader.
